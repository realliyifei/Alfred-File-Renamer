# File Renamer (Mac Alfred Workflow)

This simple workflow lets you rename the input string (i.e. filename) following the small-case-with-hyphen format.  Also, it strips some unnesessary symbols like colon.

E.G. change `A guide: Comp Neuro` to  `a-guide-comp-neuro`. 

You can easily change the python snippet to other formats as you want.

Initially, the hotkey is double-tapped SHIFT and the trigger keyword is `rn`. 

## Limitations

The input string doesn't support non-ASCII code (i.e. Chinese, etc.).
